Devlog -

December 24, 2023 -
I'm following along with the rust operating system posts in Phillip Oppermann's blog (https://os.phil-opp.com/). I'm adding a few of my own features as I go along. I plan to take this project farther than the blog does.

I'm not sure what I want to do with this operating system- whether I want to make it general purpose or have a targeted use case. A few ideas have crossed my mind.
 - Implement a very minimal JVM
 - Make a standalone typewriter, no distractions, no persistence, and a basic way to print your file after you're done
 - Port to ARM and run on a Raspberry Pi or Embedded system, possibly an RTOS for an independent wheel drive go-kart project idea I have
 - Make an ATARI-like system for a few games

Whatever I do with this project, I'm having some of the most fun coding I've had in a long time. My Rust skills are far from polished, I don't read language manuals cover to cover, I learn what I need when I need to. But doing this project I've already learned so much. I can't wait to see where I can take this.
